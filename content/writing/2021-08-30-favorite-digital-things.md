In the spirit of digital minimalism, I've cleaned out my bookmarks and compiled them into this big list. This list only includes digital things; no physical stuff, no media. The purpose of this list is three-fold:

1. Make cool things discoverable for others
2. Serve as a personal bookmark page for things I like
3. Force me to be intentional about the things I use and read

This list is constantly updated. When I find a cool new thing, I'll add it. When I lose interest in something, I'll remove it. The history of this page is tracked [via git](https://github.com/dfsnow/sno.ws/commits/master/content/writing/2021-08-30-favorite-digital-things.md).

As usual, <span class="heart">♥</span> indicates an absolute favorite.
