Hi there! My name is Dan.

I'm a data scientist at the [Cook County Assessorâ€™s Office](https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/), where I help estimate the home values used to determine property taxes. My work at the Assessor's office is part of a broader interest in [institutional reform](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-chicago-tribune-tax-divide-investigation-recap--20200921-7fjt4guj2zexhpauih2tnaccf4-story.html) and pushing local governments to use modern data tools and techniques.

Before now, I was a grad student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, where I researched [healthcare](https://sno.ws/rural-docs) and [spatial accessibility](https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1629870).

In my free time, I like to [read]({{< relref "/reading" >}}), rock climb, and hang out with my cat [Mimi]({{< relref "/photos/2020-11-30-mimi.md" >}}). I also love R and its amazing community, and briefly taught courses on how to use R for public policy work.

### Colophon

This website is heavily inspired by [Tom MacWright's blog](https://macwright.com/), though it's built from scratch using Hugo, rather than Jekyll. I really admire Tom's work and general approach to design and software, so I'm trying to replicate some of his best ideas while adding my own touches.

I also admire the work/website of [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/) and [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/), whose prolific content inspired the creation of this site.

If you like this site, you can find the source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dfsnow/sno.ws).
