Recoding America is an insider's take on why government is so bad at digital technology. Jen Pahlka uses case studies from her own career to [outline the specific forces and incentives](https://www.recodingamerica.us/concepts) that cause government tech projects to under-deliver, falter, and/or fail.

I've witnessed many of the dynamics Pahlka points out [from my own position within local government](/local-gov), and I broadly agree with her critiques. She clearly articulates some concepts I've been thinking about for awhile. My favorites were:

- **Complexity favors people with power.** Richer folks have the means (lawyers, money, time) to navigate and take advantage of complex policy changes. I've seen this play out in the assessment space; wealthier property owners are more likely to appeal their assessment and/or apply for obscure tax exemptions.
- **Policy [cruft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruft) is a barrier to implementation.** Every time a well-meaning policymaker adds another requirement or exemption opportunity to a law, the implementation gets that much harder. Keeping policy simple and low-burden makes it more effective. In the Illinois property tax space, a huge amount of cruft exists from legislators creating provisions in state-level law specific to their local community or constituents.
- **Incentives when building matter.** Current implementation strategies and oversight mechanisms measure adherence to process, not actual outcomes. This gives bureaucrats a way to de-risk and vendors cover for their crappy work.

These are really useful ideas, but they aren't packaged super well. My main complaint is that I have no idea who the audience of this book is supposed to be. It spends a lot of time explaining technical details, but does so in a way that is simultaneously not deep enough for a technical practitioner, but too deep for the average policy leader. I think Pahlka probably tried to make a good book for everyone, rather than a _great_ book for a single niche group, but the result feels a bit disorganized and overly broad.

The broadness is especially apparent in the conclusion, which contains a resounding call-to-action with very little actionable advice. Pahlka wants government to adopt the [USDS](https://www.usds.gov) model and use agile, but delegates specific action items to the book's [companion website](https://www.recodingamerica.us/take-action) (which to Pahlka's credit, _does_ contain specific to-dos for basically every likely audience member). It's a strange model and a bit of a let-down; the book does such an excellent job outlining problems that moving the "here are my solutions" part online makes it feel incomplete.

Ultimately though, this is a good book that everyone in the policy space should probably read. It has some excellent and well-articulated ideas. I just found myself (perhaps selfishly) wishing that it ended with a little more focus.
