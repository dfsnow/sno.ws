Somehow I got away with not reading Watership Down for years, despite more than
one friend telling me it's their favorite book. I'm glad I finally got around
to it, because it's _excellent_ and I loved it. The story here is simple -
rabbits embark on a journey to find a new home - but the supporting pieces are
so well-constructed that you can't help but be drawn in.

The worldbuilding is superb, particularly rabbit culture and its oral
traditions (e.g. the myths of El-ahrairah). The rabbits have history that is
more than perfunctory world-filling, it actually informs how they act in the
story.

The characters aren't the deepest; they aren't flawed in complex ways other
than being scared or sad. However, they're still incredibly loveable, rich, and
earnest, and it's fun to see how their unique qualities combine to get them out
of scrapes.

The setting is also done real justice (the down is a real place), with
rich descriptions of nature and all its creatures. I'm really a sucker for
lingering, lush prose describing natural settings, and Watership Down has that
in abundance.

All of this stuff combines with the story to make something that just _feels_
different from other novels. It feels like you're reading a **tale**, something
closer to _The Hobbit_ than to other modern fiction. It's a testament to the
power of a good story, told simply with strong, straightforward characters in
an interesting world.
