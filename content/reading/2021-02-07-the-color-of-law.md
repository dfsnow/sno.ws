The Color of Law argues that the historical housing segregation of Black Americans was de jure, rather than de facto (as most Americans believe). It cites examples of laws, contracts, and policies from across the county which were designed to prevent integration and force Black people into ghettos. It ultimately concludes that because the state bears direct (de jure) responsibility for segregation, it also has a responsibility to correct segregation's ongoing negative effects.

This argument is actually fairly narrow, but the book makes it incredibly clearly: it's well-structured, the examples are strong, and the writing is superbly concise. However, I don't actually understand who this book is for.

Perhaps unfairly, I went in expecting something along the lines of The New Jim Crow or Evicted, books that changed public discourse by presenting the consequences of bad, racist policies through powerful, understandable human stories. They forced you to empathize with individual people who, through no fault of their own, were trapped in a horrible, Kafka-esque system.

But The Color of Law just doesn't have that same emotional force. It often reads like a long, somber list of racist policies and state-sanctioned actions. At times it tries to add a human element, naming individuals who were affected by X policy, but usually these attempts feel somewhat flat and lifeless.

That's not to say The Color of Law is a bad book. In fact, it's an excellent book within the context of its narrow argument and if its goal is to convince Supreme Court justices, policy wonks, and legal scholars that American housing segregation is de jure. But if its goal is to get the wider public interested/outraged about racial segregation in housing, then I think it falls short. It just not as evocative or memorable as other books of the same breed.

That said, I'd absolutely recommend it to wonky policy people and anyone interested in race or housing.
