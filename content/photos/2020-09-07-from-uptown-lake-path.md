Call me creepy, but I really like looking at high rises. I love that you can look at one and see a hundred scenes in miniature: people cooking, watching TV, exercising, or working. People just doing mundane, human things.

It reminds me that cities and buildings are alive and filled with people. And it's somehow comforting to know that as you eat your breakfast, you're physically surrounded by people who are doing the same.
