Technically this is the [Claude Seymour House](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/residential-real-estate/foreclosed-hutchinson-street-mansion-uptown-sold), one of the most expensive houses in Uptown/Buena Park.

I always laugh when I walk by it though, because at night it looks very spooky and haunted mansion-esque. Lots of houses in Buena Park have that aesthetic for some reason. Maybe Americans' mental image of a haunted house is actually based on things built in the 1910s.
